INSTALL:
- requirements are at least postnuke 0.8 or Zikula 1.0.x
- for a correct result, hooked modules should have the right Hooks calls (new, create, modify, update, etc) in the right place
- hooked modules should have getmodulemeta() function in pnuserapi.php
- for a better result, hooked modules should have a function get() in in pnuserapi.php, which should return an array of values for a given id (eg. News_userapi_get, Pages_userapi_get, etc)
- in pndocs/crplicense_data.sql there's a set of predefined License MySQL data to be imported as example 

UPGRADE:
- standard upgrade procedure

UNINSTALL:
- default module uninstallation procedure (remember: removing an hooked module will remove his archive of tags, removing crpTag will remove every archive)
